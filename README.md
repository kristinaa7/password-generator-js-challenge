## Usage

To properly use the Password Generator, begin by clicking the red "Generate Password" button located under the textbox. From there, a popup alert will greet and ask you several questions on how to customize your password to your liking. It will first ask how many characters you would like your password to have, however keep in mind that the generator will only create passwords that are between 8-128 characters in length. If you choose a number outside the range, it will cancel the process and you will need to try again by clicking the "Generate Password" button once again. 

After the characters prompt, there are a few specific questions narrowing down your preferences on characters used in your password. It will ask if you would like to use lower cases letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. If you click "OK" through these prompts, it will log your choices until you have completed all the prompts and the final password will include the chosen characters. If you click "Cancel" through the prompts, it will not register that specific character you have delayed in your password. For example, if you clicked "Cancel" on the special characters prompt and "OK" to all the others, the password will contain only lower case, upper case and numbers characters only. 

And finally when you complete all the prompts, the password will generate in the text box with the dashed border and you are free to copy the text and use it as you seem fit.
